Wiki Tests
==========

Automated tests for the Wiki website.

Running Tests
-------------

### Java
You will need a version of the [Java Runtime Environment][JRE] installed

[JRE]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

### Python
Before you will be able to run these tests you will need to have Python 2.6 installed.

Run

    easy_install pip

followed by

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

__note__

If you are running on Ubuntu/Debian you will need to do following first

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
    
to install the required Python libraries.

### Selenium Grid
Once this is all set up you will need to download and start a Selenium Grid instance. Probably the simplest way to do this is to clone the [moz-grid-config][MozGridConfig] repository and follow the instructions in the README to start both a hub and webdriver instance.

[MozGridConfig]: https://github.com/mozilla/moz-grid-config/tree/grid2

### Running tests locally

See the [pytest-mozwebqa](https://github.com/davehunt/pytest-mozwebqa) project for details and examples of running tests.
